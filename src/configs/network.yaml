# This file defines the neural network architecture for both
# CLIP and Generation models. The embed-dim is shared between
# both models to ensure compatibility.

# Use --profile spark to select the DGX Spark configuration.

# Profile: Mac (32GB RAM, MPS GPU)
# Default profile for local development
