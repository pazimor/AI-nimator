# Network Architecture Configuration
# ============================================
# This file defines the neural network architecture for both
# CLIP and Generation models. The embed-dim is shared between
# both models to ensure compatibility.

# ============================================
# Profile: Mac (32GB RAM, MPS GPU)
# Default profile for local development
# ============================================
default:
  # Shared embedding dimension (MUST be the same for CLIP and Generation)
  embed-dim: 512
  
  # CLIP Motion Encoder Architecture
  clip:
    motion-num-heads: 4
    motion-num-layers: 2
  
  # Generation Denoiser Architecture
  generation:
    num-heads: 8
    num-layers: 4
    num-bones: 22
